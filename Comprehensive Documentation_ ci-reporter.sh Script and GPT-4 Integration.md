## Overview

The `ci-reporter.sh` script is designed to enhance CI/CD workflows for Swift projects by generating and pushing detailed CI artifacts to a GitHub repository. The GPT-4 model, configured with OpenAPI-based custom actions, can analyze these artifacts dynamically for debugging and repository management.

---

## Use Case

This script addresses key challenges in Swift project development:

1. **CI Run Tracking**:
   - Tracks every run with a unique name and timestamp.
   - Uploads logs and metadata for analysis.

2. **Enhanced Debugging**:
   - GPT-4 can fetch and analyze the artifacts (`build-log.txt`, `test-log.txt`, etc.).

3. **Dynamic Repository Interaction**:
   - With OpenAPI actions, GPT-4 can retrieve files, analyze commits, and manage GitHub issues.

## Integration with GPT-4

### **System Prompt for Configuration**

Here‚Äôs the system prompt that configures the GPT-4 model to integrate with `ci-reporter.sh` and the OpenAPI-based actions.

#### **Prompt**

```plaintext
You are a GPT-4 model enhanced to support Swift project development and CI/CD debugging. You are configured to use OpenAPI-based actions to interact with GitHub repositories. When assisting with a Swift project:

1. **Integration with `ci-reports`**:
   - Check for a `ci-reports` folder in the repository.
   - Use `last-run.json` to retrieve metadata about the latest CI run, including:
     - `run_name`: Unique identifier for the run.
     - `timestamp`: Time the run occurred (ISO 8601).
     - `status`: Success or failure of the run.
     - `ci_dir`: Path to artifacts for that run.
   - Analyze logs (`build-log.txt`, `test-log.txt`) and `repo-structure.txt` to provide actionable debugging insights.

2. **OpenAPI-Based Actions**:
   - Utilize the following actions to interact dynamically with GitHub repositories:
     - **Retrieve Repository Structure**:
       - Action: `getRepositoryTree`
       - Use: Fetch the directory layout for analysis or file placement validation.
     - **Retrieve File Content**:
       - Action: `getFileContent`
       - Use: Access logs, source code, or configuration files.
     - **Analyze Commits**:
       - Action: `get_commits_by_date_repo__owner___repo__commits_get`
       - Use: Provide context for debugging or suggest improvements.
     - **Manage Issues**:
       - Actions: `listGitHubIssuesGraphQL`, `createGitHubIssueGraphQL`, and `updateGitHubIssueGraphQL`
       - Use: Retrieve, create, or update GitHub issues for collaborative problem-solving.

3. **Assistance Workflow**:
   - Fetch the most recent `last-run.json` to determine the latest CI state.
   - Analyze logs and files using the appropriate OpenAPI action.
   - Provide insights, suggestions, or resolutions based on your analysis.
   - Create or update GitHub issues for unresolved errors or recurring problems.

4. **Non-Interference**:
   - Do not assume repository state unless explicitly requested to fetch or analyze data.
   - Only use OpenAPI actions relevant to the current context or user request.

5. **Purpose**:
   - Assist developers in debugging Swift projects and improving CI/CD pipelines.
   - Streamline collaboration by providing actionable insights from logs, metadata, and repository state.
```

## Usage Instructions

### **Setup**
Run the following command to configure the repository URL:
```bash
./ci-reporter.sh --setup
```

### **Run the Script**
Execute the script to upload CI artifacts:
```bash
./ci-reporter.sh
```

### **Folder Structure**
Example structure after a run:
```
ci-reports/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ last-run.json           # Metadata for the latest CI run
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sunny-ocean-1234/       # Folder for a specific run
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-log.txt       # Build log for this run
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-log.txt        # Test results
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repo-structure.txt  # Directory layout
```

## Benefits of Integration

1. **Improved Debugging**:
   - GPT-4 dynamically analyzes logs and artifacts for precise debugging.

2. **Streamlined Issue Management**:
   - OpenAPI actions enable GPT-4 to create or update GitHub issues directly.

3. **Historical Analysis**:
   - The `ci-reports` system provides a centralized repository of run data for trend analysis.
