# Comprehensive Development Plan for Enhancing the FountainAI OpenAPI Parser

## Objectives

1. **Support YAML Decoding and Serialization:**
   - Add the ability to parse OpenAPI YAML files directly.
   - Enable exporting the parsed Swift objects back into YAML.

2. **Interactive Spec Composition:**
   - Build a CLI tool to interactively generate OpenAPI documents using the parser’s models.

3. **Advanced Validation:**
   - Extend the existing validation logic to handle:
     - Schema references (`$ref`) resolution.
     - Parameter and path validation.
     - Cyclic dependency detection.

4. **Vapor Integration:**
   - Dynamically generate Vapor routes, controllers, and models from OpenAPI documents.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Expand unit and integration tests for the enhanced parser.
   - Provide comprehensive documentation for developers.

## Phases and Deliverables

### Phase 1: YAML Decoding and Serialization

#### Broader Perspective
YAML is the backbone of modern OpenAPI workflows because of its readability and widespread adoption. By integrating YAML decoding and serialization, the parser becomes immediately more practical and widely usable. This functionality will ensure compatibility with real-world OpenAPI files and empower developers to both **consume and produce compliant specifications**.

#### Tasks
1. Add `Yams` dependency for YAML decoding and serialization.
2. Extend `OpenAPIParser` to detect YAML files and decode them seamlessly.
3. Implement `serializeToYAML()` in `OpenAPIDocument` to allow Swift models to be exported back into YAML.

#### Motivational Goal
By the end of this phase, the parser will **fully support YAML**, making it usable with virtually any OpenAPI spec in the wild. This foundational enhancement opens the doors for all subsequent features.

---

### Phase 2: Interactive Spec Composition Tool

#### Broader Perspective
Manually writing OpenAPI specs is error-prone and tedious. By providing an **interactive CLI tool**, developers will have an intuitive way to create specs incrementally, guided by the parser's structure. This tool turns the parser into a **powerful assistant for specification creation**, helping developers save time while adhering to best practices.

#### Tasks
1. Build a CLI tool using `ArgumentParser` for creating OpenAPI documents interactively.
2. Allow users to add API metadata, paths, operations, and schemas step-by-step.
3. Enable saving the composed spec as a YAML file and validating it immediately.

#### Motivational Goal
This phase transforms the parser from a passive utility into an **active development assistant**, helping developers create robust OpenAPI specs with confidence. Seeing a complete spec generated interactively will feel rewarding and valuable.

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Validation

#### Broader Perspective
Validation is the bedrock of trust in any tool. Developers need assurance that their OpenAPI specs are correct not just syntactically but also **semantically**. Advanced validation ensures compliance with complex OpenAPI rules like `$ref` resolution, parameter matching, and schema interdependencies, **empowering developers to ship error-free APIs**.

#### Tasks
1. Add `$ref` resolution to validate schema references in `components.schemas`.
2. Implement checks for correct parameter definitions in paths (e.g., `/users/{id}` must have a corresponding `id` parameter).
3. Detect and prevent cyclic dependencies in schemas.

#### Motivational Goal
By completing this phase, the parser will become a **guardian for spec correctness**, enabling developers to catch subtle issues before they become bugs in production. This will instill confidence in users relying on the tool for critical tasks.

---

### Phase 4: Vapor Integration

#### Broader Perspective
The ultimate goal of the parser is to serve as the foundation for Vapor-based services. This phase bridges the gap between OpenAPI specifications and functional APIs by dynamically generating Vapor routes, models, and controllers. Developers can go from **specification to deployment-ready code** in minutes, revolutionizing how APIs are developed.

#### Tasks
1. **Dynamic Route Generation:**
   - Parse `PathsObject` and generate Vapor routes dynamically for HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, etc.
   - Ensure type-safe handling of path parameters and request bodies.
   
2. **Model Generation:**
   - Map OpenAPI schemas (`SchemaObject`) to Swift `Codable` structs.
   - Generate type-safe models for request and response payloads.
   
3. **Controller Scaffolding:**
   - Create reusable controllers to encapsulate business logic for each operation.
   - Auto-generate stubbed functions with correct input/output types.

#### Motivational Goal
Imagine generating a working Vapor API directly from an OpenAPI spec, with routes, models, and controllers ready to go. This phase will deliver the **dream of spec-first development**, saving hours of repetitive work and accelerating API delivery.

---

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation

#### Broader Perspective
Testing ensures reliability, while documentation ensures usability. This phase ties everything together, making the parser a polished, production-ready tool. Comprehensive testing will establish trust, and detailed documentation will lower the barrier for adoption, ensuring the parser’s longevity and widespread use.

#### Tasks
1. Expand unit tests:
   - Validate YAML parsing, serialization, and advanced validation rules.
2. Write integration tests:
   - Use real-world OpenAPI files to test parsing and Vapor integration end-to-end.
3. Update documentation:
   - Add YAML support and CLI tool usage guides.
   - Provide examples for Vapor route and model generation.

#### Motivational Goal
Seeing a **fully tested and well-documented parser** ready for real-world use is the ultimate reward. Developers will trust it, adopt it, and appreciate the effort that went into making it robust and easy to use.
